## Disclaimer!

If you're using the public version of the bot, which you can invite via [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1121127134929367152&permissions=280576&scope=bot%20applications.commands) URL, please note the following:

1. **Data Usage:** I assure you that I do not use the data you provide for any malicious purposes. Furthermore, I do not access or examine any data provided through the bot. The bot is designed to process the data you provide for its intended functionality only.

2. **Data Security:** The bot is hosted on a private Virtual Private Server (VPS), running two separate docker containersâ€”one for the bot itself and another for the database. These containers are properly secured against potential attacks to the best of my knowledge and abilities.

3. **Limited Liability:** While I take precautions to maintain the bot's security, please be aware that I am not responsible for any damage that may occur when the bot is hosted by malicious actors or similar entities. Additionally, I am not liable for any other types of damage that may arise from the use of this software.

4. **Data Deletion:** If you wish to delete your data, just run the command ``/unsetdata``. This will delete all data associated with your Discord account from the database. 

By using the bot, you acknowledge and accept the terms mentioned above.
